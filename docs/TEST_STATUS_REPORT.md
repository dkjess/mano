## Key Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed server/client boundary issue** with `next/headers` by splitting general-topic files
2. **Updated remaining `/people/general` references** to use dynamic navigation
3. **Applied database migration** for General topic conversion
4. **Fixed responsive sidebar** behavior across devices
5. **Implemented mobile-first navigation** with conversations list

## Migration Notes

### Database Changes Applied:
- General topics created for users with existing general messages
- Messages migrated from `person_id='general'` to topic references
- Constraints updated to prevent new `person_id='general'` entries
- RLS policies support topic-based access
- New user trigger creates General topic automatically

### Frontend Updates:
- Routing changed from `/people/general` to `/topics/{id}`
- Navigation helpers created for consistent routing
- Close/cancel buttons updated to use dynamic home URL
- Sidebar shows General under Coach section

## Recommendations

1. **Production Deployment**: Apply migrations carefully with backup
2. **User Communication**: Notify users that General moved to Topics section
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for any 404s on old `/people/general` URLs
4. **Testing**: Perform thorough QA with real user accounts

## Conclusion

The refactored application successfully implements all major features across desktop and mobile devices. The General topic migration is complete, responsive behavior works correctly, and the codebase is ready for production deployment after final QA testing.
