# Person Profile Onboarding: Delivering Immediate Value

## The Challenge
When users create a new person profile, they need to see immediate value or they won't understand why organizing by people matters. An empty conversation or generic "tell me about them" doesn't demonstrate Mano's unique capabilities.

## Our Solution: Guided First Conversations

### Quick Setup Protocol
Every new person conversation starts with a structured setup that takes 30 seconds but delivers immediate insights:

1. **Role** - What they do
2. **Relationship** - How they relate to the user (direct report, peer, manager, stakeholder)
3. **Current Situation** - The most important thing happening right now

### Value Delivery Formula
Based on these three inputs, Mano immediately provides:
- **Insight**: One specific observation about their situation
- **Action**: One concrete step to take this week
- **Support**: Preparation for their next interaction

## Example First Conversations

### Scenario 1: Struggling Direct Report
**User Input**: "Sarah is a Senior Developer (direct report) who's struggling with the tech lead responsibilities I just gave her"

**Mano's Response**:
"Thanks for that context! So Sarah is a Senior Developer who reports to you, currently struggling with new tech lead responsibilities.

Based on what you've shared, here's something to consider: The transition from individual contributor to leadership role is often harder than expected. Sarah might be experiencing imposter syndrome or struggling to balance coding with leadership tasks.

**Immediate action**: Schedule a 30-minute 1-on-1 this week focused solely on her tech lead challenges. Ask her: 'What part of the tech lead role feels most overwhelming right now?'

What's your next interaction with Sarah likely to be? I can help you prepare for it."

### Scenario 2: High Performer Wanting Growth
**User Input**: "Marcus - Product Manager, peer, crushing it but getting restless and talking about other opportunities"

**Mano's Response**:
"Thanks for that context! So Marcus is a Product Manager peer who's performing well but showing signs of restlessness about career growth.

Based on what you've shared, here's something to consider: High performers often leave not because they're unhappy, but because they don't see a path forward. As a peer, you're in a unique position to be both advocate and ally.

**Immediate action**: Grab coffee with Marcus this week and ask about his career vision. As a peer, you can offer to collaborate on a high-visibility project that showcases his skills to leadership.

What's your next interaction with Marcus likely to be? I can help you prepare for it."

### Scenario 3: Difficult Stakeholder
**User Input**: "Jennifer from Legal, stakeholder, always blocks our initiatives and seems to have it out for our team"

**Mano's Response**:
"Thanks for that context! So Jennifer is a Legal stakeholder who you experience as blocking your team's initiatives.

Based on what you've shared, here's something to consider: What feels like obstruction might be risk mitigation from her perspective. Legal's job is to protect the company, and she might not understand your team's goals well enough to find creative solutions.

**Immediate action**: Before your next initiative, proactively schedule time with Jennifer. Ask: 'What are the top 3 legal risks you worry about with our team's work?' This positions you as a partner, not an adversary.

What's your next interaction with Jennifer likely to be? I can help you prepare for it."
